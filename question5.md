 2. What excites you about Deputy and the opportunity?

  It's important for me to believe that what I help build is providing "real" value to someone or something. Deputy provides that kind of value to companies and the individuals that run them , enabling them to focus on what they produce or sell, and less on logistics. It's a benefit to people, and to the economy. That, in addition to the impressive list of Customers let's me know that Deputy is a brand I can stand behind, a product I can believe in, and has seen a level of success that could only be reached by great employees and solid leadership. It's clearly a place where I would be able to grow and learn.

3. What would you like us to know about you?

  I truly care about producing quality work. I do my best in all situations to deeply understand the things I'm working on- not just in software, but in life. I believe that with a level head, a little patience, and good collaboration, there's no problem that can't be solved. I enjoy working with people, and am never afraid of constructive criticism.
